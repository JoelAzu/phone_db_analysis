📘 Project Overview
This project was developed for a client seeking to derive actionable insights from a large dataset of smartphone and mobile device specifications sourced from PhoneDB. The goal was to support product strategy, market analysis, and feature benchmarking through a lightweight, data-driven tool.

The resulting solution enables fast data retrieval, dynamic analysis, and clear visualizations — all built in Python using CSV, pandas, and matplotlib.
